# Used-Car-Selector
## Overview
The Used Car Selector is a machine learning application designed to simplify the process of choosing a used car. By analyzing a variety of car features and expenses, the model provides recommendations for the best car options tailored to individual preferences and constraints.

This project stems from a personal challenge of finding the right used car where there is an overwhelming combination of options available like drivetrain, mileage, mpg and the associated costs. With the goal of streamlining the decision-making process, this project leverages the XGBoost model to with the aim of predicting used car suitability based on a user's criteria.
